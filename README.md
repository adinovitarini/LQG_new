# Notes : 
This Code was implemented in preprint paper "Linear Quadratic Gaussian using Kalman Network and Reinforcement Learning for Discrete-Time System" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362385858_Linear_Quadratic_Gaussian_using_Kalman_Network_and_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Discrete-Time_System)
# Tutorial 
1. Download all the files in one folder directory on your PC
2. Open your MATLAB apps (min. R2021a)
3. Set your workspace folder into the downloaded foldes from step (1)
4. Open file 'main.m' in MATLAB
5. Run the code
If you would like to change some parameters about :
1. the **disturbance characteristics**, you could change the code (lines 17-18)
2. the **LSTM parameters**, you should open KalmanNet.m (m-file) and then change the number of hidden units, max epochs, initial learning rate, and etc.
